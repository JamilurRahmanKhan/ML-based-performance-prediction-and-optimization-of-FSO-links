# ML-based-performance-prediction-and-optimization-of-FSO-links
An interactive Free Space Optics (FSO) Bit Error Rate (BER) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis tool with visualization features. Built using Python and Matplotlib, this tool helps researchers, students, and engineers analyze performance trade-offs in FSO systems under varying distances, power levels, and atmospheric conditions.
